## Academic Projects

### Business Capstone: B2B Manufacturing (Europe)
**April 2025 - June 2025 | Northeastern University**

Customer Segmentation & Churn Prediction across 3,000+ accounts and 130K+ orders to strengthen retention strategy in European B2B manufacturing.

- Analyzed 130K+ orders across 3,000+ customer accounts (2013–2025) to uncover revenue and retention patterns
- Built RFM segmentation to classify customers into Champions, Loyal, At Risk, and Inactive groups
- Developed a customer prioritization framework combining churn risk and revenue impact
- Trained Logistic Regression (85%) and Random Forest (99% accuracy) churn models
- Identified billions in lost revenue from churned accounts; found product diversity drove loyalty while heavy discounting signaled churn
- Recommended retention strategies: prioritize high-value at-risk accounts, embed churn scores in CRM, launch proactive engagement triggers

**Impact:** Built a data-driven foundation for proactive account management and long-term revenue protection

**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), RFM Segmentation, Machine Learning

### European Aviation Trends & Recovery Forecasting
**January 2025 - April 2025 | Northeastern University**

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of European air traffic from 2016 to 2024 to understand the impact of global events on regional travel recovery. Led the data preparation process, consolidating Kaggle datasets with external sources (Eurostat, ACI Europe) and standardizing multi-year traffic data for time-series modeling and forecasting.

- Spearheaded data cleansing and preprocessing across 300+ airports and multiple file formats
- Integrated and validated international data sources to ensure modeling accuracy and temporal alignment
- Contributed to time series models with 95%+ explanatory power for post-pandemic traffic shifts
- Built Python-based visualizations (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) used in presentations for airline and policy stakeholders

**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Time Series Analysis

### MBTA Commuter Rail Optimization Using Integer Programming
**January 2025 - April 2025 | Northeastern University**
