## Data Analyst & Automation Specialist

I'm Shae Trainor, originally from Boston, Massachusetts. I build systems that turn messy data into decisions people can actually use.

I just finished my M.S. in Business Analytics at Northeastern and work as a Data Analyst at Arcbound, where I **automate** reporting pipelines, **build dashboards**, and **deploy models** that cut manual work from **days** to **minutes**.

I focus on three things: making data accessible, automating what shouldn't be manual, and delivering insights that matter when they're needed. If it can be faster, cleaner, or more reliable, I'm interested in building it.

## What I Do

At Arcbound, I lead automation initiatives. I've built end-to-end systems using Python, APIs, web scraping, and Power BI that deliver real-time insights across digital marketing analytics, capacity planning, and client reporting.

## Technical Skills

**Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL, R, Power BI, Excel, Power Automate

**Specializations:** Data automation, ETL pipelines, business intelligence, machine learning, web scraping, API integration
