# Interests

My interests reflect the things that keep me curious and make life worth talking about. I like ideas that challenge how we see the world, but I also value experiences that are active, real, and grounding.

## Science and Technology
I am drawn to big discoveries that push the limits of what we know. Space exploration, AI, and neuroscience all spark my curiosity. I follow the developments that make you stop and think about what comes next.

## Articles and Culture
I like long-form pieces that connect strategy, business, and culture. Writing that explains hidden patterns in sports, cities, or society always catches my attention. I enjoy ideas that help me see familiar things in a new way.

## Courses and Learning
I sharpen skills in analytics and tech, but I also study areas like geography, psychology, and climate. For me, learning is about perspective, not just career.

## Beyond Work
I follow Boston sports closely, play golf, spend time by the ocean, and enjoy fly fishing. Being outdoors gives me balance and keeps me connected to the bigger picture.
