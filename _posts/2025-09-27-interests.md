This page is about the things that keep me curious, balanced, and grounded. Some of them make me think, some of them get me outside, and most of them do both.

## What I Follow
I like seeing how technology actually changes the world. Not just new apps or product launches, but the bigger shifts that change how people live and how industries work. AI, automation, and large-scale infrastructure are areas I keep an eye on because they shape the future in ways we’re only starting to understand.

## What I Read
I’m into articles that explain why things work the way they do. That could be how cities grow, why a strategy succeeds in business, or what drives trends in sports and culture. I like pieces that connect dots I wouldn’t have linked on my own.

## What I Learn
I take courses in Python, SQL, and analytics because they matter for what I do every day. I also dig into subjects like geography and psychology just because they interest me. Learning across different areas keeps me sharp and gives me new ways to see things.
