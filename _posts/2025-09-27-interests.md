# Interests

This page is a place to share what captures my attention outside of day-to-day work. It is not just about data or business but about the things that make me curious, keep me balanced, and shape who I am.

---

## Books
I like to read a mix of nonfiction, history, and biographies that help me understand how people think and how ideas evolve. I also enjoy the occasional novel when I want to step into another world.

---

## Articles and Papers
I spend time with long-form articles that explain how industries change, how people adapt, and how technology fits into the bigger picture. Academic papers also interest me when they connect theory to practical outcomes.

---

## Podcasts and Videos
I follow conversations with founders, analysts, and thinkers because hearing how others explain their journey gives me perspective. Documentaries and in-depth interviews are another way I learn from people who have built or discovered something meaningful.

---

## Courses and Learning
I keep sharpening my technical skills through online courses in analytics, coding, and machine learning. I also take time to learn about broader ideas like strategy, leadership, and decision-making.

---

## Beyond Work
Outside of professional learning, I enjoy following sports, exploring new places, and picking up hobbies that keep me active and curious. These interests help me stay grounded and remind me that growth comes from all areas of life, not just one.
