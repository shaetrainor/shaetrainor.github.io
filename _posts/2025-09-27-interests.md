Outside of work, I'm into things that either make me think or get me outside, usually both.

### What I Follow

I'm interested in how technology actually changes things. Not just new features or product launches, but the shifts that alter how entire industries work or how people solve problems. AI developments, infrastructure at scale, automation that actually matters. I like understanding what's being built and why it might stick.

### What I Read

I like articles that explain why things work the way they do. How cities grow, why certain business strategies succeed, what drives trends in sports or culture. I'm not looking for hot takes. I want the deep dive that connects ideas I wouldn't have linked on my own. The Atlantic, Stratechery, and random Substacks usually give me that.

### What I Learn

I take courses in Python, SQL, and analytics because they matter for what I do. But I also learn about urban geography and psychology just because they're interesting. To me, being good at your job and being an interesting person aren't the same thing. You need both.

### What Keeps Me Grounded

Boston sports are a constant. I play golf when I can, spend time near the ocean as much as possible, and fly fish when the timing works out. Being outside isn't just a break from work. It's where I actually think clearly and remember what matters.
