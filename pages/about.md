## Data Analyst & Automation Specialist

I'm Shae Trainor, a data analyst focused on building automated systems that transform raw data into strategic insights. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics at Northeastern University while working as a Data Analyst at Arcbound.

My work centers on automation, business intelligence, and operational analytics. I build data pipelines, develop reporting systems, and deploy machine learning models that reduce manual work and accelerate decision-making.

## What I Do

At Arcbound, I lead automation initiatives that cut reporting time from days to minutes. I've built end-to-end systems using Python, APIs, web scraping, and Power BI that deliver real-time insights across digital marketing analytics, capacity planning, and client reporting.

My approach combines technical execution with business contextâ€”whether it's extracting insights from GA4 data, modeling FTE capacity scenarios, or applying NLP to content performance analysis.

## Technical Skills

**Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL, R, Power BI, Excel, Power Automate

**Specializations:** Data automation, ETL pipelines, business intelligence, machine learning, web scraping, API integration

**Platforms:** Google Analytics 4, Apps Script, Clockify, SharePoint

## Background

Before Arcbound, I automated financial systems at Cornell Dubilier Electronics and Hingham Institution for Savings, building workflows that improved efficiency and reduced manual processes.

I hold a B.S. in Management Information Systems from Clemson University and am completing my M.S. in Business Analytics at Northeastern, where I've worked on projects ranging from European aviation forecasting to MBTA optimization using integer programming.

## Beyond Data

I'm an Investment Analyst with Northeastern's 360 Huntington Fund, where I successfully pitched a security that received unanimous approval from management, contributing to a $2 million student-managed portfolio.

In March 2025, I participated in Northeastern's Global Field Study in Silicon Valley, visiting companies including Cloudflare, BlackRock, Dell Technologies, Nutanix, and U.S. Venture Partners.
