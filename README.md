# shaetrainor.com — GitHub Pages with Millennial theme (fixed)

## Upload steps
1. Delete any old files from the repo root that you don't need.
2. Upload everything in this zip to the repo root of `shaetrainor.github.io`.
3. Commit. GitHub Pages will build automatically.

## If you still see a 404
- Ensure `_config.yml` includes `jekyll-remote-theme` in `plugins` (it does in this bundle).
- Make a tiny change to any file and commit to retrigger the build.
- Check Actions -> pages build and deployment for errors.

## Files you edit most
- `_config.yml` — site settings
- `index.md` — homepage
- `pages/*.md` — subpages
- `_posts/*.md` — blog posts
